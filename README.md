## ELT NETFLIX DATA ANALYSIS

For this project I used Python, SQLAlchemy, and SQL Server to perform an analysis of the Netflix database extracted from Kaggle.

In this project I performed data cleansing in the main table by filling in null values ​​and standardizing some data, 
then I performed schema normalization by creating new tables and finally I answered 5 questions to perform the analysis.
